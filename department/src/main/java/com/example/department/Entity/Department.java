To upgrade the Java code to use Java 17, you need to make the following changes:

1. Update the package declaration to use the new version:
```java
package com.example.department.entity;
```

2. Ensure you have Java 17 installed and configured in your development environment.

3. Update the dependencies in your build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) to use the latest versions.

4. Update the imports to use the new module system and remove unnecessary imports:
```java
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;
```

5. Update the annotations to use the new package names:
```java
@Entity
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Department {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private int did;
    private String dname;
    private String dcode;
}
```

6. Compile and run the code using Java 17.

Note: The code you provided doesn't include the Lombok library, so assuming you have that set up correctly, it should work fine with Java 17.
